Machine learning (ML) exercise: Can a ML model predict if I will buy a perfume based on my "perfume history"?

# Objective
Learn how to work with a tree based model, to predict whether I'd buy some perfume based on its olfatory notes and other characteristics

# What kind of data is this?
The list are build by me. By listing perfumes I used in the last couple of years. I created a columns called Purchased indicating if I'd buy it again.
The notes, styles and characteristics where copied from www.fragrantica.com 

# Problemns (besides my lack of experience and messy code)
I still don't have a lot of data yet.

Have fun!
